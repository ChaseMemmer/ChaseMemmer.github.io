                <h1>Graduated from U. of Alabama</h1>
                <h2>(Expected) Dec 2022</h2>
                <p>While attending the University of Alabama, I earned a 
                    Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering and another separate
                    Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. Also, I got halfway
                    through a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering before my four 
                    year, full-ride scholarship ended. While here, I also attended the 
                    Honors college and graduated cum laude (GPA > 3.5) from everything. 

                    Along with the other projects listed on this website, I would regularly 
                    participate in Student Engineers in Action (a community volunteer club),
                    help mentor freshman in the Honors college and help organize day trips
                    with the Outdoor Recreation club.

                <h1>Prosthetic Arm Research</h1>
                <h2>Aug 2022 - Current</h2>
                <h2>My current pet project.</h2>
                <p>Many of the past projects have been aimed at developing a specific sub-skill, so
                    my goal with this project is to start to combine skills into a whole product.
                    That being said, the first phase will still focus on developing my coding abilities.
                    Once finished1, the project has direct and easily detailed extensions (aka, more degrees of 
                    freedom, more "human-like" aesthetic) which I hope to pursue, even while working. 
                    </p><br><p>
                    In essence, I am researching and attempting to design both the hardware and 
                    software of a prosthetic arm with three degrees of freedom (corresponding to 
                    elbow, wrist flexion/extension and 4-finger grasping). Software-wise, I'm aiming 
                    for real-time filtering and processing of EMG data through several different machine 
                    learning techniques. I'll select the best from those. Most of the fundamental
                    research is done and I'm beginning to source parts for a preliminary budget scope so I 
                    order parts mid-September.

                <h2>Space-grade Energy Harvesting System</h2>
                <p>I'm the team lead among five students (supervised by a professor) whose goal is to design 
                    and manufacture an Energy Harvest System (EHS) for a satellite. The state 
                    of Alabama is attempting to be the first state to send a fully functional 
                    satellite, that has been designed by only students, into space. Along with 
                    six other teams (at other colleges, for other parts of the satellite), my team is following NASA's published
                    standards and are managed by a team of System Engineering graduate students. 
                </p><br><p>
                    My responsibilities include designing all the hardware, management of the 
                    other four members, budgeting and sourcing/ordering parts. I'm also the first 
                    point of contact for issues in the software, of which there are many. The EHS 
                    consist of solar panels, a PCB to control/optimize the harvested 
                    energy, a PCB to control battery charging/discharging 
                    and a DC-DC conversion board for the three rails other satellite instruments 
                    will draw from. Of course, everything is in-house and digitized for communication 
                    with the Command Center. There are also safety sub-systems for various stages 
                    of satellite deployment.

                <h2>900 miles without breaks</h2>
                <p>I thoroughly enjoy the outdoors, so I thought it would be exciting
                    to hike the Appalachian Trail. Overall, I started at the southern
                    terminus and hiked 900 miles over 7 weeks. It was extremely taxing, 
                    both mentally and physically, but I hiked until I had to return to school 
                    (with some room to say hello to my family first). The scenery was 
                    amazing and I met tons of new people every day. The most interesting 
                    thing that I learned is how deceptively easy it is to climb a mountain.

                <p>Dielectric Elastomer Actuators (DEAs) are the current leading technology 
                    that could replace human muscle tissue. However, they're also extremely 
                    robust as a normal actuator, with the main downside being the high operating
                    voltage. During the semester long project, I researched, modelled and built 
                    a functioning set of modular DEAs by myself. The modelling was done in LTSpice 
                    and then designed to KiCAD.
                </p><br><p>
                    The DEA itself has an oscillator powered by two 9V batteries, a current amplifier then 
                    several methods to increase the voltage. The final voltage was ~1600V. Note, the part 
                    names in the picture below are placeholders for the actual parts that were used.

                <p>Quincy Compressor holds ~25% market share of compressor sales in the USA. Between 25% and 35% of 
                    all electricity generated in industrialized contries goes into compressing air, so R&D for 
                    these specific devices is essential for both economical and enviornmental reasons. 
                    </p><br><p>
                    As an engineering intern in the R&D department, I was tasked with helping 
                    maintain the lab. My primary jobs included data collection/analysis of every 
                    compressor undergoing product testing, calibrating/sending out equipment and defining/updating 
                    lab procedures for new ASME, ISO and third-party standards, as well as OSHA requirements. 
                    I also had several projects which included designing a new testing rig, modifying 
                    compressor parts for R&D and sourcing/overseeing contractors on lab improvement projects. 
                    The largest responsibility I had was a $15.000 project aimed towards replacing extremely sensitive 
                    flow sensors. I worked well enough to earn a standing offer of employment, for after graduation, from the 
                    Senior Manager for the R&D lab (my direct supervisor).

                <h2>3x Nat'l Champion & Mechanical Team Lead</h2>
                <p>The yearly NASA Robotic Mining Competition is held by NASA and invites 50 top universities to 
                    build the most effective robot that can reach certain targets. The objectives when I 
                    participated revolved around autonomy and reaching simulated 'icy regolith' far below the 
                    surface (two times the height of the robot and further). NASA uses this competition to source 
                    ideas for their own robot, so I like to think my designs have influenced their official projects.
                </p><br><p>
                    During my freshman year, I designed and introduced a mechanical design that tripled average production 
                    (it also doubled the entire competition's single best run) and firmly placed the University 
                    of Alabama in first place. The next two years NASA introduced some serious changes, but the team 
                    stayed on top. During my second year, most of the senior members had graduated, so it was only 
                    one other sophomore and I were doing 80% of the work. By my third year on the team, I was the 
                    Mechanical Team lead and our robot had doubled it's production from before and shrunk to a third of size.

                    double as a way for the Software team to improve their localization program since they 
                    could make arbitrary obstacles. Altogether, I spent about two months porting a simplified 
                    robot from Solidworks to CopelliaSim (a ROS program) and getting it to move and interact with 
                    the environment. Unfortunately, the project was scrapped because of issues visualizing it 
                    in a VR headset.

                <p>After taking a class on C, I was heavily interested in learning more about it. During 
                    my Co-op at Quincy Compressor, I spent a significant amount of time coding after work. Along with several small 
                    practice projects, I coded a character generation program using ncurses. It guides the user 
                    through a process that generates qualities for a character in a book, movie or other medium. 
                    The goal was to make interesting, non-cliche characters by enforcing a point system. If the character 
                    is amazing and has tons of positive qualities (charming, intelligent, beautiful etc.) then it 
                    must also have some bad qualities to round it out. However, rather than just a simple text editor, 
                    the program reacted to trends in quality selection to generate some additional qualities. Sometimes 
                    restrictions were made on selections, sometimes restrictions were lifted, sometimes restrictions were 
                    arbitrarily added. I thoroughly enjoyed the creativity of the characters that resulted and I still 
                    like ncurses as a library despite how old it is.

                    certification and entered college with 102 credits (not all of which were applicable 
                    though). Even at this time, I was still interested in R&D Engineering and was focusing 
                    my extracurriculars towards it.

                <h1>Engineer Intern at APG Electric</h1>
                <h2>June 2015 - July 2015</h2>
                <p>During high school, I worked under two Professional Engineers in Plumbing and Fire 
                    Safety. My responsibilities included check, modifying and updating blueprints. I like 
                    to include this in my resume to show that I'm not some kid who decided what they want 
                    to do halfway through college. I've been focusing on Engineering for a long time and have 
                    been crafting my education and professional experiences the entire time. I am certain about 
                    what I want to do, and I have the abilities to achieve my goals.
